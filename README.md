# Mongo-Scraper

In this assignment, you'll create a web app that lets users view and leave comments on the latest news. But you're not going to actually write any articles; instead, you'll flex your Mongoose and Cheerio muscles to scrape news from another site. You can scrape news, save articles and make comments on specific news that interests the user.
